    "As you likely already know, Python is a key component of the modern data scientist's toolbox. You will not be expected to understand Python for ECMM 6020, but it is good to get some exposure to how the technology works in a functional setting. If you haven't already, take a look at the data.csv file. This file consists of some 500 000 e-commerce transactions from a UK online retailer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by doing some basic exploration using Python. Our first task will be to retrieve subsets within this dataset. To do this, we will need to import the file to the Python environment. You may have noticed that the file is a csv file type-- this stands for comma separated files. We will use a special CSV python library to import the data and manipulate it in this environment. The following expression opens the data file and saves it in a Python dictionary type. You can learn more about the Python csv library here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html"

One of the powerful features of Python is that it treats every string as an object. Basically, this means that you can use fewer lines of code to do complex things in Python. For programmers, this probably scares you--this feature makes it really easy to make bugs. However, for a data scientist, this is super-handy! \n",
